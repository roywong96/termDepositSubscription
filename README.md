# Term Deposit Subscription: Case Study Overview

- Cleaned and Preprocessed the Dataset.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to gain insights and trends in the data.
- Perform One-Hot Encoding for the categorical variables used for modeling.
- Optimized K Nearest Neighbors, Bayesian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier using GridSearchCV to reach the best model.
- A deep dive into data leakage to prevent target from leaking into models I chose for an accurate prediction.
- Performance measure used to evaluate the models is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (RUC) Curve.
